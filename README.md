# k8s binary

This **UNOFFICIAL** Kubernetes binary repository complements [kwokctl] for Darwin and Windows.

It is available for development and testing purposes only. 

The repository is set up to automatically check for the latest version daily.

When a new version is available, a build and [release] are triggered.
